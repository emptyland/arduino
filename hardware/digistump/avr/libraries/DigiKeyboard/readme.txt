This is a modified combination of the excellent TrinketKeyboard library from Adafruit 
and the old DigiKeyboard library From Digistump based on AVRUSB by Obdev

With contributions by Digistump (Erik Kettenburg), Bluebie, and the Digistump community


Obdev license maintained in the usbdrv folder

Adafruit license below

Digistump makes its modifications/additions under the same LGPL

Many Thanks to Obdev and Adafruit

===============================================================================


TrinketKeyboard is a part of Adafruit's Trinket/Gemma USB HID Arduino Library

TrinketKeyboard allows the user to implement a simple USB keyboard inside the Arduino environment

Please see TrinketKeyboard.h for usage documentation, an example is also included

TrinketKeyboard uses V-USB (http://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/) to implement USB with a bitbang technique. See the folder "usbdrv" for V-USB files.

Adafruit's Trinket and Gemma can do almost anything that V-USB can do, including USB mouse, keyboards, joysticks, gamepads, MIDI devices, and much more (including custom devices that do not fit any existing category).
